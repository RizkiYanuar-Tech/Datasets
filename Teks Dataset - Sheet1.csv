"Doctors have long known that syphilis can permanently damage a person’s vision and hearing and can even lead to psychiatric changes, but these symptoms are usually associated with infections that have gone undiagnosed and untreated for years. More than two-thirds of these patients (68%) lacked typical syphilis symptoms, like a rash or chancre sore, that might tip doctors off to the infection. “Providers definitely need to be screening more and be aware that this is what we’re seeing,” said lead study author Dr. Amy Nham, who is a first year EIS officer, or “disease detective,” assigned to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Syphilis cases are surging across the US.
